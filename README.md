<p>
<h4>Create Azure Virtural Machines</h4>

</p>
<p>
Deploy an Azure VM running Windows Server 2022 to host Active Directory Domain Services, configuring the VM's size, region, and networking settings with a public IP and RDP access for remote connection. The serverâ€™s private IP address is set to static.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Deploy a second VM running Windows 10 (22H2) to join the domain. Ensure the VM size, regions, and networking are configured, as it will also need RDP remote access.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
In Azure change the DNS settings on the Windows 10 (client) VM to point to the domain controller using the server's VNet private IP, then restart the VM.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Disable the firewall for both VMs through Windows Defender Firewall to allow for connectivity testing.
</p>
<p>

<p>
<h4>Active Directory Domain Services Installed on Windows Server</h4>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82f5b9b3-5704-4012-8e62-939b90ed2f0c)

</p>
<p>
Add the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role to the Windows Server 2022 VM using Server Manager.
</p>
<p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41268788-e34a-4630-9d5f-34dff5768552)

</p>
<p>
Install the AD DS role on the server.
</p>
<p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb4a2082-0350-413b-a9fa-5cb4587cf07c)

</p>
<p>
Promote the server to a Domain Controller by selecting "Promote this server to a domain controller."
</p>
<p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e873a841-e9dc-435f-b775-8faa1d502c97)

</p>
<p>
Add a new forest and specify the domain name (e.g., mydomain.com).
</p>
<p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fffae21-eb50-4801-b13f-81d94f9b08d4)

</p>
<p>
Provide the Domain Admin credentials during the promotion process.
</p>
<p>
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b95c2e1-c5ad-458e-bc12-dc0f256dd50f)

</p>
<p>
Install the Domain Controller (DC) role and complete the configuration. After the server restarts, the Domain Admin credentials are set up successfully.
</p>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<h4>Domain Membership and Connectivity Verified</h4>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61480065-cd96-4a0c-992a-50089eebac00)

</p>
<p>
The necessary Domain Admin credentials are entered, and after restarting the VM, users can log in using domain credentials (mydomain.com\username).
</p>
<p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32353a93-c307-40d5-9cf9-08f148578a9b)

</p>
<p>
Open Active Directory Users and Computers on your Domain Controller, create an Organizational Unit (OU) called _EMPLOYEES, and a second OU named _ADMINS under your domain.
</p>
<p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eb974b2-f424-4b90-b3ce-9226c368e68c)

</p>
<p>
Right-click on the _ADMINS OU and create a new user to set up a Domain Admin user. 
</p>
<p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ab53e69-0d4d-4983-a306-0a36bf611175)

</p>
<p>
Right-click on the user, select Properties, and assign them Domain Admin privileges.
</p>
<p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98f43f6d-8b5f-4a8b-973d-842b0800271d)  

</p>
<p>
Go to the client VM and sign in to the domain using the new admin credentials.
</p>
<p>

<p>
<h4>Windows 10 VM Joined to the Domain</h4>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e50a1a76-92f9-4520-aadc-4aede8a30008)

</p>
<p>
Sign out and sign back into the client VM domain as the local admin (labuser). Then, connect the client VM to the domain by going to Start > Settings > System > About > Rename this PC (Advanced) > Change, and enter 'mydomain.com'.
</p>
<p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98f43f6d-8b5f-4a8b-973d-842b0800271d)

</p>
<p>
Use the domain admin credentials to log in to the domain on the client VM.
</p>
<p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bd54faf-31b7-49c0-b2f3-10dc0c5b4eb8)

</p>
<p>
The client VM is now connected to the domain. A restart is required. Upon logging back in, the client VM will be a member of the domain.
</p>
<p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41905e10-11ca-4502-9986-e3f5aa166a62)

</p>
<p>
Return to the DC VM and log in as mydomain.com\jane_admin. Verify that the client VM is connected to the domain by checking Active Directory Users and Computers in the Computers OU.
</p>
<p>


</p>
<br />

<p>

<h4>Users and Group Policies Configured</h4>


















</p>
<p>

  
</p>
<br />

<p>





</p>
<p>
The Windows 10 (22H2) VM was connected to the domain by accessing Control Panel and joining the domain (mydomain.com). The necessary Domain Admin credentials were entered, and after restarting the VM, users could log in using domain credentials.
</p>
<br />
<p>
<h>Domain Membership and Connectivity Verified</h> 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ab53e69-0d4d-4983-a306-0a36bf611175)

Log into the client VM (Windows 10) using domain credentials. Then, open Active Directory Users and Computers on the Domain Controller (Windows Server 2022) as an admin to manage user accounts and groups.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Domain membership was verified by logging into the Windows 10 VM using the domain credentials, and pinging the domain from both the Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10 VMs confirmed proper connectivity between the domain controller and the client machine.
</p>
<br />

<p>

Users and groups were created and managed on the Windows Server 2022 VM using Active Directory Users and Computers. Group Policy Management was set up to create domain-wide policies, like password rules and account lockout settings, to make sure security was the same across the entire domain.

This setup successfully created a working On-premises Active Directory in Azure using Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10 (22H2), with domain management done efficiently through PowerShell and Remote Desktop.
